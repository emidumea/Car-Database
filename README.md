# Car-Database
I developed a relational database system designed to manage a car dealershipâ€™s inventory, transactions, and customer interactions, ensuring data integrity, security, and efficiency. The project enforces business rules through constraints and PL/SQL triggers, preventing inconsistencies and optimizing performance.
